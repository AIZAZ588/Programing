#include <iostreram> --> includes header file(iostreram.h) for input(cin) and output(cout). This enhance out program capabilities
using namespace std  --> defining that we are using standerd key words i.e cin,out etc .
                         Means that are not userdefined functions,
                         we can also defind our own namespace like in this example
